## Installation & basic usage

1. Install the `opencensus/opencensus-exporter-stackdriver` package using [composer][composer]:

    ```bash
    $ composer require opencensus/opencensus-exporter-stackdriver:~0.1
    ```

1. Initialize a tracer for your application:

    ```php
    use OpenCensus\Trace\Tracer;
    use OpenCensus\Trace\Exporter\StackdriverExporter;

    Tracer::start(new StackdriverExporter());
    ```

## Customization

You may provide an associative array of options to the `StackdriverExporter` at
initialization:

```php
$options = [];
$exporter = new StackdriverExporter($options);
```

The following options are available:

| Option | Default | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `client` | `new TraceClient($clientConfig)` | A configured [`TraceClient`][trace-client] to use to export traces |
| `clientConfig` | `[]` | Options to pass to the default TraceClient |
